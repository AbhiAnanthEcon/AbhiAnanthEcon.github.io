I am an econometrician focusing on problems arising in networks and industrial organization. 

In my job market paper, I study the optimal allocation of a limited number of vaccines among members of a networked population in the presence of spillovers.

I completed my PhD at Cornell University under the supervision of Francesca Molinari (chair), Larry Blume, David Easley and JÃ¶rg Stoye.

**I am currently a postdoc at the Institute of Economics and Econometrics at the University of Geneva.  I will join the Emory QTM department as an assistant professor in the fall of 2022.**
