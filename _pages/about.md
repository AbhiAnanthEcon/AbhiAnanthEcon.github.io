I am a PhD candidate in the department of Economics at Cornell University.

My reserach focuses on econometric problems arising in networks and industrial organization. Since, I am Indian, I also have a theory paper in development economics ;).

In my job market paper, I study the optimal allocation of a limited number of vaccines among memebers of a networked population in the presence of spillovers.

I am working under the supervision of Francesca Molinari (chair), Larry Blume, David Easley and JÃ¶rg Stoye.

I will be available for interviews both at the EEA Annual Meeting (Date TBD), CEEE Meeting (Date TBD) and the ASSA Annual Meeting (January 3rd-5th, 2021).
