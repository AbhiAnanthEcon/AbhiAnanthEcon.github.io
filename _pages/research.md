## Working Papers

**[Job Market Paper: Optimal allocation of treatments on networked populations](http://AbhiAnanthEcon.github.io/files/Ananth_JMP_draft.pdf)** 

*Abstract:*

My job market paper explores the optimal distribution of a limited number of pre- ventative treatments (eg: vaccines) for a deadly communicable disease such as malaria or Ebola among individuals on a network. While the literature has considered the optimal distributions of treatments in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects, the main contribution of this paper lies in accommodating for spillovers in treatments. This paper explicitly models disease propagation on the contact network for diseases such as Ebola or malaria. I extend the empirical welfare maximization (EWM) proce- dure considered in Kitagawa, Tetenov (2018) to estimate an optimal treatment assign- ment rule using data from a randomized control trial (RCT). Like Kitagawa, Tetenov (2018), I provide a finite sample bound for the effectiveness (measured in terms of uni- form regret) of the proposed procedure. This is the first paper to establish theoretical guarantees for the treatment assignments under restriction on the spillovers and the network structure. I demonstrate that the welfare attained by EWM converges to the maximum attainable welfare as the size of the RCT grows. I also show that there can exist no other statistical procedure with a faster rate of convergence.
